        <p class="center">The year is 1011, and from all quarters the people of Iceland are gathering to have disputes heard in the law courts and to heed the wisdom of the Lawspeaker. Artisans will sell their wares, warriors will train with sword, axe, and bow, and chieftains will extend their hospitality to their people.  This is a theme event where we will be attempting to recreate a specific culture, place, and time--in this case, early 11th century Iceland. Those attending the event are encouraged to dress in Norse or contemporary clothing, and to choose and use a Norse name for the day (if you do not already have your own). Our event was inspired by the first Icelandic Althing event presented by Eoforwic in 1992. Since that time, Norse culture has grown and spread throughout Ealdormere, and many new resources have become available to help attendees prepare for the event. You will find links to many of these below.</p>

		<h3>WELCOME, visitor, to the alÃ¾INGI!</h3>
		<p>You may be familiar with your own little Things<a class="inline" href="#foot1"><sup>1</sup></a>, but this is the largest Thing in the world<a class="inline" href="#foot2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and things of great importance are done here<a class="inline" href="#foot3"><sup>3</sup></a>.Â  Pay heed to the Lawspeaker and the words of the law<a class="inline" href="#foot4"><sup>4</sup></a>!</p></div>

		Â <p class="center">The HÃ¡vamÃ¡l<a class="inline" href="#foot5"><sup>5</sup></a> bids us welcome guests with hospitality:<br />
		A guest has needs, gift of water, fine towels and friendliness.<br />
		A cheerful word, a chance to speak, kindness and concern.<br />
		So come you, be refreshed, take your comfort, and learn of our ways.</p>

		Â <p>So, too, the bishops<a class="inline" href="#foot6"><sup>6</sup></a> bid us be neighbourly.Â  As they would gather their flocks, so the 39 GoÃ°ar<a class="inline" href="#foot7"><sup>7</sup></a> gather the people of the goÃ°orÃ°<a class="inline" href="#foot8"><sup>8</sup></a> of which they are chieftain. All must be gathered by the appointed time; each householder bringing their part of the shelter to where their GoÃ°i's booth will be set up, that they may be known to be there<a class="inline" href="#foot9"><sup>9</sup></a>, and may be given their allotment and their place to rest in the shared shelter.</p>

		Â <p>We are gathered from the four quarters of Iceland - North, South, East, West - at the Ãžingvellir<a class="inline" href="#foot10"><sup>10</sup></a>, where the waters of the Ã–xarÃ¡rfoss cascade into Ãžingvallavatn<a class="inline" href="#foot11"><sup>11</sup></a>, as free folk have gathered for 79 years<a class="inline" href="#foot12"><sup>12</sup></a>.Â  Here is the law rock<a class="inline" href="#foot13"><sup>13</sup></a>, where all should attend<a class="inline" href="#foot14"><sup>14</sup></a>, and where all who have cause may speak.Â  Here may oaths be sworn before all, here covenants made, and here may cases that could not be settled in one of the thirteen district courts be brought to their rightful quarter court at the Thing<a class="inline" href="#foot15"><sup>15</sup></a>.Â  Once the procession to the law rock - the Lawspeaker, the GoÃ°ar, and judges - is complete, then the Thing is called to order, and then the people of the four quarters go to the appointed places for their quarter courts.</p>
		
		<p>If a case is to be heard in the quarter court, and rightful summons have been issued at the law rock, then the judges are gathered<a class="inline" href="#foot16"><sup>16</sup></a>, witnesses are heard<a class="inline" href="#foot17"><sup>17</sup></a>, and judgement is made<a class="inline" href="#foot18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

		Â <p>But be not hasty to bring suit; know the rights of your case.Â  A just killing is not murder, but your repute is not that of a man who would attack from ambush or strike an unarmed man, so you are no murderer<a class="inline" href="#foot19"><sup>19</sup></a>.Â  But mind your tongue, for the law tells us if "a man calls a man ragr or stroÃ°inn or sorÃ°inn... they shall be punished as fully slanderous words, and a man is given the right to kill for these words."Â  So too, the giving of a by-name that brings a man into disrepute is cause for greater outlawry<a class="inline" href="#foot20"><sup>20</sup></a> and exile for life, as is pushing a man to the ground, or pushing his hat forward over his face<a class="inline" href="#foot21"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>Â 
		Â 
		<p>Punishment by lesser outlawry is for lesser crimes.Â  But who would want to be exiled from home, and hearth, from kith and kin, from Iceland, for even three years?Â  And even the most affluent would not want their property forfeit for crimes of theft or foreswearing a bond... or perhaps the more affluent might even mind it more.Â  So mind yourself, but fear not for your goods or your wealth, for the law is for all.</p>

		Â <p>Think always as you conduct yourself at the Thing, how you will be remembered, and how you would want to be remembered.Â  For as the HÃ¡vamÃ¡l tells us:<br />
		Cattle die, kinsmen die, all men are mortal.<br />
		Words of praise, will never perish, nor a noble name.</p>

		Â <p>Many great tales are told of heroic deeds, of wisdom and wise council, of prowess and cleverness.Â  Theirs are the names that will be remembered and praised by all.Â  Tales are told, too, of dark deeds, of faithlessness, of cowardice, of weakness, and of crime.Â  These too are names that will not be forgotten, but will ever be cursed.Â  Let your children be proud of your name, let their children be raised with tales of your greatness, and let your children's, children's children use your deeds as an example to all.</p>

		Â <p>But do not think that all at the Thing is trial and judgement, for here too are gathered the young folk of the land - and many arrangements that are not matters of law will be made - and here is where all may show their worth for all to see.Â  Here are news and stories shared, here craftsmen show their wares, and here visitors come, to learn and to share tales and to trade.</p>

		Â <p>And perhaps when you return whence you came, you will share our tales with others, and speak well of our ways, and of the doings here.</p>

		Â <p>So, welcome visitor, to the greatest Thing in the world!</p>
		<div style="display:none">
		  <div id="foot1">	Through much of the Norse world, gatherings would be held - often under the auspices of a local chief - to arbitrate disputes, make agreements, etc.</div>
      <div id="foot2">	Yes, the pun is the same in Old Norse.Â  But remember, it's not the size of your thing, it's what you do with it.</div>
      <div id="foot3">	As well as being larger, the Icelandic AlÃ¾ingi differed from similar gatherings in other Norse realms, such as Norway, in two important ways.Â  Because there was no king in Iceland, the AlÃ¾ingi was the court of last appeal - there was no king to appeal to - and it was also, effectively, the legislative body for Iceland - as there was no king to make laws.</div>
      <div id="foot4">	The Lawspeaker was elected at the AlÃ¾ingi for a term of three years, and was expected to recite one third of the law each year at the Thing.Â  Later, in 1117, the laws were written down, but the Lawspeaker continued to preside at the Thing.</div>
      <div id="foot5">	The HÃ¡vamÃ¡l, or Words of the High One (the wisdom of Odin); a verse form guide to life, known through the Norse world.</div>
      <div id="foot6">	At the AlÃ¾ingi of 1000 the decision was made that all Icelanders were to be baptised.Â  While old ways continued, the decision of the Lawspeaker made everyone in Iceland officially Christian.</div>
      <div id="foot7">	Iceland was divided into 39 groupings, each with its own chieftain.Â  The GoÃ°ar, together with the Lawspeaker (and in later years nine additional judges) would form the LÃ¶grÃ©tta (law council) to decide points of law and enact new law.</div>
      <div id="foot8">	Generally a district, but some goÃ°orÃ° were not geographic in nature but rather an association of people who followed a particular GoÃ°i.</div>
      <div id="foot9">	A three mark fine could be assessed for being late, so everyone had to be there on time, and sign in.</div>
      <div id="foot10">	Literally, the AlÃ¾ingi vale.Â  The site was chosen in part because it was relatively central, and also as the lands had come available when the previous owner had been made an outlaw for murder.Â  The site is neutral, not belonging to any quarter nor to any district.</div>
      <div id="foot11">	The largest waterfall and the largest lake in Iceland. The valley is part of the mid-Atlantic rift.</div>
      <div id="foot12">	The first AlÃ¾ingi.was held in 930.</div>
      <div id="foot13">	A large rock that is key to official proceeding of the Thing.Â  Here the Lawspeaker will stand to speak, here the Law council meets, here oaths are sworn, here are contracts made, here are judgementsÂ  issued.</div>
      <div id="foot14">	Anyone who has a case to bring / agreements to make / etc. will summon all parties - the principles, witnesses, judges, etc. - from the law rock at a set time.Â  The summons sets out who you are, who they are, what they are called for, and what you expect of them.Â  If the accused party doesn't show up at the appointed time, perhaps because they aren't at the Thing or they didn't hear the summons, then they are presumed to not offer a argument, and judgement will be against them.</div>
      <div id="foot15">	There was one court for each quarter, which would deal with cases that could not be settled in a district court and with cases that were between different goÃ°orÃ°.</div>
      <div id="foot16">	Any 'male of 12 winters or more, capable of taking responsibility for what he says or swears, free, of a settled home... [not] a principle in prosecution or defence... learned to speak [Norse] in childhood [or] has been in Iceland three winters or more' may be nominated to be a 'judge' / member of the jury panel.Â  The jury of peers was very much that, in that the members would be those who lived closest to the parties in dispute, were closest kin to parties in dispute, etc.Â  Someone could challenge to be made a member if they felt they had a better claim than another member of the court.</div>
      <div id="foot17">	'Witnesses' were usually not expected to speak to matters of fact - 'I saw him do it' - but to matters of repute - 'He is / is not the kind of man to do that' - i.e. character witnesses.Â  Further, witnesses were expected to co-ordinate their testimony, and were expected to stay close to what the summons indicated that they would say.</div>
      <div id="foot18">	After all testimony was heard, the prosecution and defence would summarise their cases, and the panel would discuss the case until they reached a majority verdict.Â  One member of the panel would be selected by lot to present the verdict; a split verdict could also be returned, but only if the panel was split exactly six / six.</div>
      <div id="foot19">	Again, it is about reputation.Â  A charge of murder for a cowardly killing is as much an attack on the reputation of the accused as it is a charge in court.</div>
      <div id="foot20">	Greater outlawry is exile for life.Â  The exile would be given a set time to leave Iceland, after which time his life is forfeit if he is seen in Iceland.Â  It is possible, though, for the exile's family to petition a subsequent Thing to have the sentence reduced.</div>
      <div id="foot21">	Common thread being that they are insults to dignity, and dignity is an important part of reputation.</div>
